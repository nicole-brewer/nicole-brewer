### Hi, my name is Nicole :wave:

üë©‚Äçüéì graduate research assistant to [Manfred Laubichler](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/manfred-laubichler)

üìú PhD student in **Computational History and Philosophy of Science** at Arizona State University

üíª former **research software engineer**

My current formulation of my research question for my dissertation is...

> What scientific values (such as reproducibility, openness, and reusability) should we embody in our standards of practice and infrastructure for the betterment of computationally enabled science?

My will start out my dissertation by exploring the limits of reproducibility in the computational sciences. I also plan to use **dynamic network analysis** and **natural language processing** to analyse large corpuses of scientific literature to study evolving standards of practice. Finally, I'm interested in using **qualitative methods** to survey and observe groups that are currently attempting to reconsile competing values in proposing standards of practice. I will also report out on my own experience setting standards of practice by developing a ruberic for the peer-review of [notebook submissions](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) to the [inaugural US-RSE Conference](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/). 

### I'm currently...

üë©‚Äçüè´ running an internship program for my amazing full-time summer interns, [Namita Shah](https://github.com/namitasshah) and [David Costello](https://github.com/Dcosthephalump), who are helping me develop data dashboards and scientific web applications*
