### Hi, my name is Nicole :wave:

I'm a graduate research assistant and research software engineer. I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computational History and Philosophy of Science under the guidance of Manfred Laubichler at Arizona State University. I plan to use network science to analyse large corpuses of scientific literature for evolving standards of practice.

### I'm...

:microphone: editing an episode of my ["Long Tails of Science"](https://www.breaker.audio/long-tales-of-science) podcast. This one is all about reproducibility as SC'23.

:purple_heart: developing templates for [Jupyter notebook submissions](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) to the [inaugural US-RSE Conference](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/). 

:book: reading ["Progress and Its Problems: Towards a Theory of Scientific Growth "](https://www.amazon.com/Progress-Its-Problems-Larry-Laudan/dp/0520037219) by Larry Laudan.

:snake: studying [The Missing README: A Guide for the New Software Engineer](https://www.amazon.com/Missing-README-Guide-Software-Engineer/dp/1718501838/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YCX2LOQKQ3H1&keywords=the+missing+readme&qid=1679284830&s=books&sprefix=the+missing+readme%2Cstripbooks%2C164&sr=1-1) which is my favoritate book so far that attempts to fill in the chasm between the computer scienec degree and the first software engineering position.

:climbing_woman: back into rock climbing, because that's what all the grad students are up to.

:musical_keyboard: taking jazz piano lessons.
