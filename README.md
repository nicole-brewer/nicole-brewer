### Hi, my name is Nicole.

### I'm...

:purple_heart: a proud contributer of the DEI Working Group within the [Research Software Engineering Association](https://us-rse.org/).

:books: reading Thomas Khun's philosophy of science classic, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, becaues I believe that deductive, empirical, and computational reasoning are important aspects of the scientific method.
