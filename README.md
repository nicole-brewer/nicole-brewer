### Hi, my name is Nicole :wave:

I'm a graduate research assistant and research software engineer. I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computational History and Philosophy of Science under the guidance of Manfred Laubichler at Arizona State University. I plan to use natural language processing to analyse large corpuses of scientific literature to study the relationship between reproducibility and standards of practice.

### I'm...
