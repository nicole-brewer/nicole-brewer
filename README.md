### Hi, my name is Nicole :wave:

I'm a graduate research assistant and research software engineer. I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computational History and Philosophy of Science at Arizona State University. My advisors are Manfred Laubichler and Jane Maienschein. My current formulation of my research question for my dissertation is...

> What scientific values (such as reproducibility, openness, and reusability) should we embody in our standards of practice and infrastructure for the betterment of computationally enabled science?

My will start out my dissertation by exploring the limits of reproducibility in the computational sciences. I also plan to use **dynamic network analysis** and **natural language processing** to analyse large corpuses of scientific literature to study evolving standards of practice. Finally, I'm interested in using **qualitative methods** to survey and observe groups that are currently attempting to reconsile competing values in proposing standards of practice. I will also report out on my own experience setting standards of practice by developing a ruberic for the peer-review of [notebook submissions](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) to the [inaugural US-RSE Conference](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/). 

### I'm...

:microphone: editing an episode of my ["Long Tails of Science"](https://www.breaker.audio/long-tales-of-science) podcast. This one is all about reproducibility as SC'23.

:purple_heart: drafting the rubric for the peer-review [Jupyter notebook submissions](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) to the [inaugural US-RSE Conference](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/). 

:book: reading ["The limits of replicability"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13194-019-0269-1) by Stephan Guttinger.

:snake: developing matierials for the SciPy'23 tutorial "How the Little Jupyter Notebook Became a Web App: Managing Increasing Complexity with nbdev" as part of the [Better Scientific Software Fellowship](https://bssw.io/fellows/nicole-brewer)

:climbing_woman: back into rock climbing, because that's what all the grad students are up to.

:musical_keyboard: taking jazz piano lessons.
